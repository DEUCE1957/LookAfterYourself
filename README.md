## Notes
1. Adding Events

⋅⋅⋅Only users that are staff members are able to add an event. At the moment, this privilege is only able to be granted through the DJango Admin interface.⋅⋅

2. Search Function

⋅⋅⋅At the moment, the search function will not display any results. This is due to the fact that in order for it to be functional, Google's crawler bot must first index the page and this takes around 20 days to complete. Once this time is up, the search function should work as expected.⋅⋅

3. Tips Filter

⋅⋅⋅After some problems with styling and changing the CSS file location, currently the filter bar for selecting a catergory for tips has a basic styling that I am unable to change. However, the functionality of the bar is still intact.⋅⋅
